# Repeated DNA Sequence

## Statement

>A DNA sequence consists of nucleotides represented by the letters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' only. For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a valid DNA sequence.

Give a string, `s`, that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (continuous substrings of exactly 10 characters) that appear more than once in `s`. You can return the output in any order.
