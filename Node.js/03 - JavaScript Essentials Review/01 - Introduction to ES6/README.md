# Introduction to ES6

## ES6 Background

**ES6**, which stands for "**ECMAScript 6**", is the sixth version of ECMAScript. It was published in 2015, and it's also known as ECMAScript 2015. ECMAScript provides a standard for JavaScript.

## Why Use ES6?

ES6 offers more concise and intuitive syntax, including template strings, arrow functions, modules, and classes. Its language features help make code more readable.

Modern web browsers can efficiently execute ES5, but ES6 doesn't have full browser compatibility. To use the comlete set of ES6 features today, we'll need to transpile (or rewrite) our code back down to ES5 so that current browsers can interpret it. Transpiler tools like Babel and Traceur help make this process easier. We can use either tool to transpile ES6 in the browser or the server.

JavaScript is a constantly evolving language. With each new version of ECMAScript released, improved language features are introduced to make a developer's life easier.
