# Write to a File

Implement a `writeFile()` function that asynchronously writes data to `test.txt`, replacing all existing data with new data passed to `writeFile()`.

We can write to a file with `fs.writeFile()`. This method accepts two arguments:
  - File path
  - Data to write

After writing `test.txt` with the implemented function, check the contents of `test.txt` displayed by the `readFile()` function.
